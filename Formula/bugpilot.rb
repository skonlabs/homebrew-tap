# Homebrew formula for the BugPilot CLI.
#
# This file lives in a Homebrew tap repo (e.g. skonlabs/homebrew-tap).
# Users install with:
#   brew tap skonlabs/tap
#   brew install bugpilot
#
# To update after a release:
#   1. Download the new macOS binaries from the GitHub Release.
#   2. Compute sha256: shasum -a 256 bugpilot-macos-*
#   3. Update the `url` and `sha256` fields below for each bottle block.
#   4. Bump `version`.
#   5. Commit and push to the tap repo.

    <<~EOS
      Shell completions are not installed automatically.
      To enable them, add one of the following to your shell profile:

        # bash (~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc)
        eval "$(bugpilot --completion bash)"

        # zsh (~/.zshrc)
        eval "$(bugpilot --completion zsh)"

        # fish (~/.config/fish/config.fish)
        bugpilot --completion fish | source
    EOS
  end

  test do
    system "#{bin}/bugpilot", "--version"
  end
end
